 Use data validation to ensure user enters exactly nine distinct and valid integers,
 for example, no duplicate or non-numeric values or integers less than 1 or greater than 9 should be accepted; 
 
 3- Use appropriate logic to make sure random number generator generates distinct set of valid integers!

 5- Once the grid is fully populated, displaying the grid in a 9 x 9 matrix format, followed by the decision of whether it forms a valid Sudoku solution or not;
